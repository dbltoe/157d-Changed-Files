# 157d-Changed-Files

All the files that were changed from 1.5.7c to 1.5.7d

When a new version is released, I use a commercial comparison software to find and keep the changed files in the folder order they are already in.

This repository is the result of checking a clean download of 1.5.7d against a clean download of 1.5.7d.

It's not that I don't trust the list of changed files that is provided.  I just like to have something I can easily use to upgrade when the situation is just a few changed files and no database upgrade.

CAUTION:  These files are changed in 1.5.7d AND may also have been modified by someone so that the current 1.5.7c files on your site are NOT in their original state.

If anyone has modified ANY file in the areas covered, use a comparison software to make sure you don't overwrite some previous customization.

As usual, BACKUP FIRST!  These files are provided as a helpful tool with no guarantees whatsoever.
